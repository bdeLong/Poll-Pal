# Poll-Pal

## APIs:

Google Civis API: https://developers.google.com/civic-information/
ProPublica API: https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/
Opensecrets.org API, where money was spent

## Project Description:

An application (mainly mobile responsive) targeted towards ages 18-35, that utilizes civic API information to pull polling information to help people knowledgeably vote. Ideally, the user will input address, and all information from local all the way to national elections will populate (polling place, candidates running, propositions, etc.). Users will also be able to look up representatives voting initiatives, voting record, contact info, etc. The vision is that while people are at the polls, they’ll be able to look up important information in order to make an informed decision at the polls. We’ll also try to incorporate some type of GPS API that allows users to find their polling place. Or (pipedream) use Uber or Lyft to get rides to polling place.
